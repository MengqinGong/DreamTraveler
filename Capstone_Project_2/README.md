## Classification on Fashion MNIST Dataset

### Problem
Image classification is a classic question for deep learning. In this project, I will try to build a model to classify fashion MNIST data into 10 classes. This project is a practice on an advanced dataset than MNIST(10 categories of handwritten digits), the final model can serve as the starting point for image classification project on similar dataset.

Potential clients of this project can be: fashion website which is looking for a classification model to automatically classify fashion images; anyone who wants to build a classification model on similar dataset such as MNIST and more complex dataset with appropriate modification on data and model; and deep learning beginner who wants to get started with image classification.

### Methods
#### Classification using Machine Learning Methods
-   SGD Classifier  
-   Decision Tree Classifier  
-   Random Forest Classifier
#### Classification using Deep Learning Methods
-   CNN with 1 Convolutional Layer  
-   CNN with 2 Convolutional Layers
-   CNN with 3 Convolutional Layers
-   Transfer Learning using VGG19

### Result
#### Final Model
CNN with 3 Convolutional Layers
|Accuracy Train| Accuracy Validation|Accuracy Test|
|--|--|--|
| 0.949 |  0.931|0.928|
